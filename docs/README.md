### Command Format & Syntax Rules

Before using Dawn, take note of the following general command rules:

* **Words in `[brackets]` are parameters:** Parameters enclosed in square brackets are required arguments to be provided by the user.  
  *Example:* In `todo [description]`, `[description]` is a parameter (`todo read a book`).
* **Command keywords are lowercase:** Commands like `todo`, `list`, and `help` must be entered in lowercase.
* **Parameterless commands reject extra arguments:** Commands that take no arguments (`list`, `help`, `bye`) will show an error if additional characters or arguments are typed (e.g., `list 123` or `bye now` will be rejected).
* **Task numbers are 1-based positive integers:** For `mark`, `unmark`, and `delete`, task numbers refer to the index displayed in the `list` command and must be positive integers (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`).
* **Marker order in events:** For `event` commands, the `/from` clause must precede the `/to` clause.
* **Keyword searches are case-insensitive:** The `find` command will match tasks regardless of uppercase or lowercase (e.g., `find book` matches `Book` and `BOOK`).

---

### Task Display Notation & Status Icons

When viewing tasks through `list`, `find`, or `view`, each task entry is formatted with concise status and type tags:

| Symbol / Tag | Meaning | Example |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| `[T]` | **ToDo task:** A simple task without dates or times. | `[T][ ] read a book` |
| `[D]` | **Deadline task:** A task due by a specific date or time. | `[D][ ] submit assignment (by: 20 Nov 2026 23:59)` |
| `[E]` | **Event task:** An event spanning a start and end time. | `[E][ ] orientation (from: 12 Oct 2026 14:00 to: 12 Oct 2026 16:00)` |
| `[ ]` | **Pending status:** The task has not been completed yet. | `[T][ ] read a book` |
| `[X]` | **Completed status:** The task has been marked as done. | `[T][X] read a book` |

*Note: Dates and times with recognized calendar formats are automatically displayed in clean English format (`dd MMM yyyy` or `dd MMM yyyy HH:mm`, e.g., `12 Oct 2026 14:00`).*

---

### Supported Date & Time Formats

For commands that require calendar references (`deadline`, `event`, and `view`), the following structured formats are strictly recognized and allow calendar date tracking:

* **YYYY-MM-DD** `[HHmm]` (e.g., `2026-10-12` or `2026-10-12 1800`)
* **D/M/YYYY** `[HHmm]` (e.g., `12/10/2026` or `2/1/2026 0800`)

> [!TIP]
> **Flexible text fallback:** When creating a basic `deadline` or `event`, if your date string does not match the precise calendar formats above (e.g., typing `"Monday 10am"`, `"tomorrow night"`), Dawn will flexibly save it as standard text. However, you will *not* be able to search for these freeform text dates using the strict `view` command.

---

### Adding a todo task: `todo`

  * `todo read a book`

### Adding a deadline task: `deadline`

## <span style="color:#006064">FAQ</span>

**Q**: How do I save my data? Do I need to run a save command?  
**A**: There is no manual save command. Dawn **automatically saves** your tasks to the hard disk in the background after any data creation or modification (e.g., adding, marking, or deleting a task). When you start the application again, your data is seamlessly loaded into the session.

**Q**: Where is my data saved?  
**A**: Your data is securely saved in a `dawn.txt` file located in the `data/` folder within the same directory as the `.jar` document.
