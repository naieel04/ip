# Dawn UI test plan

Run these tests from the repository root after compiling with Java 25:

```powershell
$javaSources = @(Get-ChildItem -Path src\main\java -Recurse -Filter *.java | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName)
javac -d out\production\ip $javaSources
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .codex\skills\test-ui\scripts\run-ui-tests.ps1 -ProgramCommand 'java "-Dstdout.encoding=UTF-8" -cp out/production/ip dawn.Dawn'
```

The messages use Piplup's voice. Task entries and the command table stay factual. `${STORAGE_BYE}` replaces `${BYE}` after any storage problem, including skipped damaged records; ordinary validation errors do not change the goodbye.

Each case is a new console session. The listed inputs are entered in order, and the expected output is the complete session transcript. The runner expands the following output tokens before it compares output exactly, apart from platform line endings, final newlines, and trailing padding on a line.

## Output tokens

**Aim:** Confirm that `help` repeats the complete startup command table without the banner, preserves the current task list, and rejects extra arguments.
**Inputs:**
```text

## Focused storage failure verification

The companion Java checks exercise failures that cannot be represented by a
plain saved-file fixture in the console runner:

- Reject the first file replacement, verify the attempted task is rolled back,
  then save another task successfully and still show the storage-problem goodbye.
- Attempt to load a directory as the saved file, report the load error, and use
  the storage-problem goodbye without claiming that everything is saved.
- Verify failed replacement leaves the original file intact, failed saves roll
  back add/mark/unmark/delete, and escaped fields survive a save/load round trip.

Run this after the full console plan with Java 25:

```powershell
$javaSources = @(Get-ChildItem src/main/java -Recurse -Filter *.java | Select-Object -ExpandProperty FullName)
javac -d out/test $javaSources test/dawn/PiplupStorageTest.java test/StorageRegressionTest.java
java -cp out/test dawn.PiplupStorageTest
java -cp out/test StorageRegressionTest
```
